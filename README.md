# uc_std

Standard C++ library for accessing certain features of different embedded development frameworks for microcontrollers using one common API

This library is primarly targeted for use in combination with the PlatformIO IDE (or PIO CLI), however it can be used with other IDEs as well (possibly with some minor adjustments).
